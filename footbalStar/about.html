            <p > Pope Uzonna Okolo was born in Ogidi, Anambra State. 
                He was brought up in the council house he shared with
                 his parents Elizabeth and Josiah Okolo along with his siblings. 
                 Like any other boy in his town it was always Popeâ€™s dream 
                 to become a footballer. 
                 At the age of 12 he joined the academy of the club he supported,
                  Golden boys FC.

                Aged just 16, Pope announced himself to the world
                when he scored a spectacular hat trick in 20 minutes after
                 he was subtituted in 70th minutes to go,
                the goals that took his team to  Semi-final of Governors cup.
                he became the youngest player to score hatric and the fastest hat trick
                 in the compitition.
                
                He has since gone on to become a famous footballer,
                 winning a number of titles with Golden Fc, 
                 some inter states compititons.

                    In September 2017, Pope Okolo broke Sunday Aneke's record 
                    to become Golden boys fastest goal goalscorer, when he scored
                     gaol in just 1 minute 52 seconds, 
                     In 2018 he became the first player in the compitition to
                      score the fastest hat trick in  just 20mins to go.
                     Then in  2019,

                     the first player to score 8 goals in his first 10 games.
